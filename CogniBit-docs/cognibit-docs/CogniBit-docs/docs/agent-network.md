# Understanding CogniBit Agent Network

The CogniBit Agent Network is a decentralized system where AI models (called Agents) can be trained, validated, and utilized by network participants.

## Network Architecture

- **Peer-to-peer** structure with no central authority
- **Reputation system** for model quality assessment
- **Incentive mechanism** using CBT tokens

## CogniBit CAVE (Controlled Agents Virtual Environment)

CAVE provides:
- A sandboxed environment for testing Agents
- Simulation of real-world conditions
- Performance benchmarking tools
- Security validation protocols

### Using CAVE
1. Deploy your Agent to CAVE
2. Configure test parameters
3. Run simulations
4. Review performance metrics
5. Optimize your Agent
